# Data Visualization with Python
Unlock the potential of geographic data visualisation without requiring complex GIS applications! Using Python and Matplotlib allows for effortless creation of spectacular visualisations for elevation data. This script transforms raw elevation data into a fascinating 3D surface plot, contour lines and more.
Missing GIS expertise? No worries! This script employs Python's extensive library ecosystem, using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting. The outcome? A visually captivating encounter showcasing elevation changes, slope degrees, and hillshade effects.
Specialized tools' learning curve is a thing of the past with this code exhibiting Python's versatility and accessibility for geospatial data visualization. Empower your projects and presentations with visually engaging and informative graphics.

# XLS to Shapefile
Convert your excel file to the GIS format shapefile.

# Shapefile to XLS 
Convert your shapefiles to excel file with its geometry column without requiring GIS Applications!

# Geotag Photos
Automatically geotag photos with python
Your csv file should content Name,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude fields. Your .jpeg files name must match the Name value in the .csv file. If you don't want to modify the script, the .py file and the data must be placed in the same folder.

# Skip Query
Have the error distance between points calculated according to your own threshold

# Generate Points Along Lines
You can generate equal interval points for geophysics methods (MASW,NTDEM,HVSR,DMASW). The output points will have ID (Seq Number), Name (coming from line name), Type (given method), X (Easting) and Y (Northing), Latitude and Longitude. The input shapefile Geometry Type must be Line and it should contain "Name" field. The .shp should have spatial reference system UTM. One shapefile can contain many lines.
